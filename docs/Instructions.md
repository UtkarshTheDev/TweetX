### **🛠 Project: TweetX – A Twitter (X) Contribution & Engagement Tracker**  
Create a **FastAPI server** named **TweetX** that fetches a user's Twitter (X) data using **Twint or snscrape** (if Twint has issues). The API should **process, store, and return advanced Twitter activity stats** in an optimized JSON format for a **highly interactive frontend dashboard**. The frontend should feature **animated graphs, heatmaps, and real-time stats visualization** for a **crazy UI experience**.

## **⚙️ How to Build It (Step-by-Step Guide)**  

### **🛠 1. Set Up FastAPI Server**
- Install **FastAPI, Redis, Twint (or snscrape), and Uvicorn**.  
- Use **Docker for deployment** (optional but recommended).  

---

### **📦 2. Fetch Twitter Data Efficiently**
- Use **Twint** (or **snscrape** if Twint doesn’t work).  
- Store raw tweets **temporarily in Redis** for quick re-processing.  

---

### **📊 3. Process Data into Stats**
- Count total tweets **per year, month, day, and hour**.  
- Extract **likes, retweets, and replies**.  
- Identify **most engaging tweets** (highest likes, retweets, replies, impressions).  
- Analyze **hashtags & mentions** frequency.  

---

### **🔥 4. Optimize with Caching**
- **Use Redis** to store computed stats for **10-15 minutes** to avoid re-fetching according to the username so that stats not get mismatched.  
- Expire cache after **15 minutes** to allow updates without overloading the server.  

---

### **🌍 5. Deploy on Fly.io (or Render if needed)**
- Use **Docker** to package the app.  
- Set up a **Redis instance** for caching.  
- Configure the API to **auto-scale** based on requests.  

---

## **✅ Final Deliverables**
- A **FastAPI REST API** with well-documented **endpoints**.  
- **JSON responses** optimized for frontend display.  
- **Error handling** for invalid usernames & API failures.  
- **Production-ready Docker setup** for hosting.  

👉 **Extra:** If needed, include a **Celery-based background task** to **pre-fetch & store stats** to improve performance for large accounts.
